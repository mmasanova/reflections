What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
An emtpy git repository gets created. In this repository we can then track
changes to the files in the directory. Initilization is needed to let git 
know that I want to track the changes to the files in this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an area where files that will go to next commit are added. 
Working directory contains all of the files from last commit and all of our changes 
since then, we may only choose some of these for next commit. Repository contains 
all commits that have been made so far.
